Recognition of hand written digits

# Data
Dataset Reference - https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data
Data provided from Kaggle dataset includes handwritten digits of 70,000 images labeled from 0 to 9. Built different classifiers and compared the results between each other. Initially baselined the results using a logistic regression multi-class model. Analysed and chose the best parameters to get maximum accuracy on test data. Later built a CNN model using two hidden layers which resulted in a better performance. 

# Result
Logistic regression model gave an accuracy of 91% while CNN model resulted in 97% accuracy.
